# üìò Business Case: Employee Feedback Portal

## üß© 1. Project Title
**Employee Feedback Portal ‚Äì Enhancing Participation through Digitization**

## üìå 2. Problem Statement
The current paper-based employee feedback system suffers from low participation, lack of anonymity, and inefficient processing. Employees are hesitant to provide honest feedback due to privacy concerns, and management lacks timely, structured input to drive improvements.

## üéØ 3. Business Objective
To develop a secure, anonymous digital feedback platform that:
- Encourages honest participation  
- Provides real-time feedback data to management  
- Reduces manual effort and cost involved in processing feedback  
- Improves employee engagement and organizational transparency  

## üè¢ 4. Background & Context
Employee feedback is a key driver for organizational improvement. However, due to the limitations of a physical, manual system, our current participation rate is below 35%, and actionability of feedback is delayed. A modern digital platform is essential for a growing and evolving workforce.
